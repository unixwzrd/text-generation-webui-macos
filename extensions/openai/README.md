# An OpenedAI API (openai like)

This extension creates an API that works kind of like openai (ie. api.openai.com).

## Setup & installation 

Install the requirements:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

It listens on ```tcp port 5001``` by default. You can use the ```OPENEDAI_PORT``` environment variable to change this.

Make sure you enable it in server launch parameters, it should include:

```
--extensions openai
```

You can also use the ``--listen`` argument to make the server available on the networ, and/or the ```--share``` argument to enable a public Cloudflare endpoint.

To enable the basic image generation support (txt2img) set the environment variable ```SD_WEBUI_URL``` to point to your Stable Diffusion API ([Automatic1111](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)).

For example:
```
SD_WEBUI_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7861
```

## Quick start

1. Install the requirements.txt (pip)
2. Enable the ```openeai``` module (--extensions openai), restart the server.
3. Configure the openai client

Most openai application can be configured to connect the API if you set the following environment variables:

```shell
# Sample .env file:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
OPENAI_API_BASE=http://0.0.0.0:5001/v1
```

If needed, replace 0.0.0.0 with the IP/port of your server.


### Models

This has been successfully tested with Alpaca, Koala, Vicuna, WizardLM and their variants, (ex. gpt4-x-alpaca, GPT4all-snoozy, stable-vicuna, wizard-vicuna, etc.) and many others. Models that have been trained for **Instruction Following** work best. If you test with other models please let me know how it goes. Less than satisfying results (so far) from: RWKV-4-Raven, llama, mpt-7b-instruct/chat.

For best results across all API endpoints, a model like [vicuna-13b-v1.3-GPTQ](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/vicuna-13b-v1.3-GPTQ), [stable-vicuna-13B-GPTQ](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/stable-vicuna-13B-GPTQ) or [airoboros-13B-gpt4-1.3-GPTQ](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/airoboros-13B-gpt4-1.3-GPTQ) is a good start.

For good results with the [Completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) API endpoint, in addition to the above models, you can also try using a base model like [falcon-7b](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b) or Llama.

For good results with the [ChatCompletions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) or [Edits](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/edits) API endpoints you can use almost any model trained for instruction following. Be sure that the proper instruction template is detected and loaded or the results will not be good.

For the proper instruction format to be detected you need to have a matching model entry in your ```models/config.yaml``` file. Be sure to keep this file up to date.
A matching instruction template file in the characters/instruction-following/ folder will loaded and applied to format messages correctly for the model - this is critical for good results.

For example, the Wizard-Vicuna family of models are trained with the Vicuna 1.1 format. In the models/config.yaml file there is this matching entry:

```
.*wizard.*vicuna:
  mode: 'instruct'
  instruction_template: 'Vicuna-v1.1'
```

This refers to ```characters/instruction-following/Vicuna-v1.1.yaml```, which looks like this:

```
user: "USER:"
bot: "ASSISTANT:"
turn_template: "<|user|> <|user-message|>\n<|bot|> <|bot-message|></s>\n"
context: "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.\n\n"
```

For most common models this is already setup, but if you are using a new or uncommon model you may need add a matching entry to the models/config.yaml and possibly create your own instruction-following template and for best results.

If you see this in your logs, it probably means that the correct format could not be loaded:
```
Warning: Loaded default instruction-following template for model.
```

### Embeddings (alpha)

Embeddings requires ```sentence-transformers``` installed, but chat and completions will function without it loaded. The embeddings endpoint is currently using the HuggingFace model: ```sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2``` for embeddings. This produces 768 dimensional embeddings (the same as the text-davinci-002 embeddings), which is different from OpenAI's current default ```text-embedding-ada-002``` model which produces 1536 dimensional embeddings. The model is small-ish and fast-ish. This model and embedding size may change in the future.

| model name | dimensions | input max tokens | speed | size | Avg. performance | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| text-embedding-ada-002 | 1536 | 8192| - | - | - |
| text-davinci-002 | 768 | 2046 | - | - | - |
| all-mpnet-base-v2 | 768 | 384 | 2800 | 420M | 63.3 |
| all-MiniLM-L6-v2 | 384 | 256 | 14200 | 80M | 58.8 |

In short, the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model is 5x faster, 5x smaller ram, 2x smaller storage, and still offers good quality. Stats from (https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html). To change the model from the default you can set the environment variable ```OPENEDAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL```, ex. "OPENEDAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL=all-MiniLM-L6-v2".

Warning: You cannot mix embeddings from different models even if they have the same dimensions. They are not comparable.

### Client Application Setup


Almost everything you use it with will require you to set a dummy OpenAI API key environment variable.

With the [official python openai client](https://github.com/openai/openai-python), set the ```OPENAI_API_BASE``` environment variables:

```shell
# Sample .env file:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
OPENAI_API_BASE=http://0.0.0.0:5001/v1
```

If needed, replace 0.0.0.0 with the IP/port of your server.

If using .env files to save the ```OPENAI_API_BASE``` and ```OPENAI_API_KEY``` variables, make sure the .env file is loaded before the openai module is imported:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv() # make sure the environment variables are set before import
import openai
```

With the [official Node.js openai client](https://github.com/openai/openai-node) it is slightly more more complex because the environment variables are not used by default, so small source code changes may be required to use the environment variables, like so:

```js
const openai = OpenAI(Configuration({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  basePath: process.env.OPENAI_API_BASE,
}));
```

For apps made with the [chatgpt-api Node.js client library](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api):

```js
const api = new ChatGPTAPI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  apiBaseUrl: process.env.OPENAI_API_BASE,
})
```

## API Documentation & Examples

The OpenAI API is well documented, you can view the documentation here: https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference

Examples of how to use the Completions API in Python can be found here: https://platform.openai.com/examples
Not all of them will work with all models unfortunately, See the notes on Models for how to get the best results.

Here is a simple python example.

```python
import os
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']="sk-111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111"
os.environ['OPENAI_API_BASE']="http://0.0.0.0:5001/v1"
import openai

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
  model="x",
  messages = [{ 'role': 'system', 'content': "Answer in a consistent style." },
    {'role': 'user', 'content': "Teach me about patience."},
    {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "The river that carves the deepest valley flows from a modest spring; the grandest symphony originates from a single note; the most intricate tapestry begins with a solitary thread."},
    {'role': 'user', 'content': "Teach me about the ocean."},
  ]
)
text = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
print(text)
```

Because of the differences in OpenAI model context sizes (2k, 4k, 8k, 16k, etc,) you may need to adjust the max_tokens to fit into the context of the model you choose.

Streaming, temperature, top_p, max_tokens, stop, should all work as expected, but not all parameters are mapped correctly.

Some hacky mappings:

| OpenAI | text-generation-webui | note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| model | - | Ignored, the model is not changed |
| frequency_penalty | encoder_repetition_penalty | this seems to operate with a different scale and defaults, I tried to scale it based on range & defaults, but the results are terrible. hardcoded to 1.18 until there is a better way |
| presence_penalty | repetition_penalty | same issues as frequency_penalty, hardcoded to 1.0 |
| best_of | top_k | default is 1 (top_k is 20 for chat, which doesn't support best_of) |
| n | 1 | variations are not supported yet. |
| 1 | num_beams | hardcoded to 1 |
| 1.0 | typical_p | hardcoded to 1.0 |
| logprobs & logit_bias | - | experimental, llama only, transformers-kin only (ExLlama_HF ok), can also use llama tokens if 'model' is not an openai model or will convert from tiktoken for the openai model specified in 'model' |
| messages.name | - | not supported yet |
| user | - | not supported yet |
| functions/function_call | - | function calls are not supported yet |

## Future plans
* better error handling
* model changing, esp. something for swapping loras or embedding models
* consider switching to FastAPI + starlette for SSE (openai SSE seems non-standard)

## Bugs? Feedback? Comments? Pull requests?

To enable debugging and get copious output you can set the ```OPENEDAI_DEBUG=1``` environment variable.
