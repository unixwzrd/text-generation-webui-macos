# OLD VERSION - 1.3.1 Patched for macOS and Apple Silicon

Patched and working with macOS and Apple Silicon M1/M2 GPU now.

GGML support is in this release, and has not been extensively tested. From the look of upstream commits, there are some changes which must be made before this will work with Llama2 models.

If you want the most recent version, from the oobabooga reposiotry, go here: [oobabooga/text-generation-webgui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui)

Otherwise, use these instructions I have on putting together the macOS Python environment. These instructions are not only useful for setting up oobabooga, but also for anyone working in data analytics, machine learning, deep learning, scientific computing, and other areas that can benefit from an optimized Python GPU environment on Apple Silicon.

* [oobabooga macOS Apple Silicon Quick Start for the Impatient](https://github.com/unixwzrd/oobabooga-macOS/blob/main/macOS_Apple_Silicon_QuickStart.md)

I will be updating this README file with new information specifically regarding macOS and Apple Silicon.

I would like to work closely with the oobaboogs team and try to implement simkilar solutions so the web UI can have a similar look and feel.

Maintaining and improving support for macOS and Apple Silicon in this project has required significant research, debugging, and development effort. If you find my contributions helpful and want to show your appreciation, you can Buy Me a Coffee, sponsor this project, or consider me for job opportunities.

While the focus of this branch is to enhance macOS and Apple Silicon support, I aim to maintain compatibility with Linux and POSIX operating systems. Contributions and feedback related to Linux compatibility are always welcome.

Anyone who would like to assist with supporting Apple Silicon, let me know. There is much to do and I can only do so much by myself.

## Installation

Currently only manual installation until an installer can be put together.

* [Building Apple Silicon Support for oobabooga text-generation-webui](https://github.com/unixwzrd/oobabooga-macOS/blob/main/macOS-Install.md)

* [oobabooga macOS Apple Silicon Quick Start for the Impatient](https://github.com/unixwzrd/oobabooga-macOS/blob/main/macOS_Apple_Silicon_QuickStart.md)

## Downloading models

Models should be placed inside the `models/` folder.

[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-generation&sort=downloads) is the main place to download models. These are some examples:

* [Pythia](https://huggingface.co/models?sort=downloads&search=eleutherai%2Fpythia+deduped)
* [OPT](https://huggingface.co/models?search=facebook/opt)
* [GALACTICA](https://huggingface.co/models?search=facebook/galactica)
* [GPT-J 6B](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B/tree/main)

You can automatically download a model from HF using the script `download-model.py`:

    python download-model.py organization/model

For example:

    python download-model.py facebook/opt-1.3b

To download a protected model, set env vars `HF_USER` and `HF_PASS` to your Hugging Face username and password (or [User Access Token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)). The model's terms must first be accepted on the HF website.

**NOTE:** You may want to create symbolic links in the model directory since sometimes there are multiple models downloaded with different quantizations, or on external storage due to space on th edisk where you insatlled this.  If you have external storge, like I do, you can create a link by going to the models directory and creating the link to your model.

#### GGML models

You can drop these directly into the `models/` folder, making sure that the file name contains `ggml` somewhere and ends in `.bin`.

#### GPT-4chan

<details>
<summary>
Instructions
</summary>

[GPT-4chan](https://huggingface.co/ykilcher/gpt-4chan) has been shut down from Hugging Face, so you need to download it elsewhere. You have two options:

* Torrent: [16-bit](https://archive.org/details/gpt4chan_model_float16) / [32-bit](https://archive.org/details/gpt4chan_model)
* Direct download: [16-bit](https://theswissbay.ch/pdf/_notpdf_/gpt4chan_model_float16/) / [32-bit](https://theswissbay.ch/pdf/_notpdf_/gpt4chan_model/)

The 32-bit version is only relevant if you intend to run the model in CPU mode. Otherwise, you should use the 16-bit version.

After downloading the model, follow these steps:

1. Place the files under `models/gpt4chan_model_float16` or `models/gpt4chan_model`.
2. Place GPT-J 6B's config.json file in that same folder: [config.json](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B/raw/main/config.json).
3. Download GPT-J 6B's tokenizer files (they will be automatically detected when you attempt to load GPT-4chan):

```
python download-model.py EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B --text-only
```

When you load this model in default or notebook modes, the "HTML" tab will show the generated text in 4chan format.

## Starting the web UI

    conda activate textgen
    cd text-generation-webui
    python server.py

Then browse to 

`http://localhost:7860/?__theme=dark`

Optionally, you can use the following command-line flags:

## Presets

Inference settings presets can be created under `presets/` as yaml files. These files are detected automatically at startup.

The presets that are included by default are the result of a contest that received 7215 votes. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/oobabooga/oobabooga.github.io/blob/main/arena/results.md).
